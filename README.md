## DEPLOYMENT & TESTING

----

write here the process of deploying the site w/ any differences between development code and deployed code.

## KNOWN BUGS

----

Kept having issue with row in main content of Resume, Contact and About Me pages. Fixed bug by adding Margin: Auto to the effected columns.

As I am unexperienced in JS at this point. The email contact form doesn't have a use, and I am not a fan of using mailto because it interrupts the user's experience on the site if they are directed to their default mail app.
