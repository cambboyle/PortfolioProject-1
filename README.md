## OVERVIEW

*https://cambboyle.github.io/PortfolioProject-1/*

This is a website aimed at creating an online portfolio for myself, showcasing some of my skills and technical abilities.

Built using **HTML** and **CSS**.

## UX

----

#### Project Goals

My main goal for this project was to create a intuitive and responsive portfolio that I can use for my career after the project has been submitted. 

My target audience for this project is potential clients/employers.

#### User Goals

- Easy site navigation with large buttons, easy-to-read colours and fonts.
- Learn a bit about me and my skills and interests.
- Locate completed projects.
- Be able to contact me directly from the site by email or by using the buttons/links in the footer to my social media accounts.

#### Developer Goals

- Thought out UX/UI design to ensure that every page is navigable from every page, ensuring the user doesn't get lost or ever have  to press the back button.
- A professional portfolio built only using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap5.
- A project where I can keep updating it and expanding on it as my career progresses.

## Design Choices

The overall design of the website was made to 1. Be easy to navigate for employers/clients and 2. be attractive to any person who views my portfolio.

#### Fonts

- The font I chose to use for my portfolio was Montserrat from google fonts. I love this font because depending on the font weight, it can look like a completely different font, making it versatile to use across the site.

#### Icons

- The icons I used were chosen simply for their purpose i.e. LinkedIn logo was used for the button linked to my LinkedIn.

#### Colouring

- The darker tone of the site was used so that the information I was putting on my site stood out more and is easier for viewers to read. I believe this tone also makes the site look a bit more professional.

- The brighter colours were used for the content of the site, as I said above, to stand out against the darker background. The colours between site pages have no meaning behind them as such. They are just nice bold colours to distinguish the pages the on the site.

#### Style

- I used the same rounded box to contain all of the content on each page, this was used throughout my site to provide consistency when people are viewing the website.

#### Images

- The main images used on the site are of myself, I used these particular images because they are formal, professional-looking images. I opted to use a photo of myself for the main background to the website as I think it will build a connection and formality with a potential employer/client before they have spoken to me.

- The placeholder images I used for the Projects page are not my own, they are royalty free images and credited in the credits section of this README. When I actually have projects of my own, I will use thumbnails of those projects instead.

## FEATURES

- Easily navigable
- Expandable Projects Page - Very simple to create more project boxes for when I need to.

## DEPLOYMENT & TESTING

----

#### Testing

*write here how I tested the site on various browsers, screen sizes and devices. As well as asking my girlfriend and family members to navgiate the site and provide feedback from their devices*



#### Deployment

*write here the process of deploying the site w/ any differences between development code and deployed code.*



## KNOWN BUGS

----

Kept having issue with row in main content of Resume, Contact and About Me pages. Fixed bug by adding Margin: Auto to the effected columns.

As I am unexperienced in JS at this point. The email contact form doesn't have a use, and I am not a fan of using mailto because it interrupts the user's experience on the site if they are directed to their default mail app.
